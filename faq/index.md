## How do people become homeless?
A family member dies, become sick with disabling medical condition, become hospitalized, lose a job, get divorced, can't hold a job, be put in jail, turn 18 as a foster child, flee from violence, abuse and/or drug addiction, can't afford rent increase, etc.

## Why should I be concerned?
1. Homelessness causes, complicates and exacerbates serious health problems. Our neighbors without shelter are poor, sick, tired, hungry and desperate for our help. In our community where we live, people without shelter die almost 27 years earlier than the average life expectancy in the United States.
1. God wants us to help the poor. 
1. Helping others is the right thing to do.
